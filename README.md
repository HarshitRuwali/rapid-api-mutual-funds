# Rapid-api Mutual-Funds with FastAPI

Rapid api integration with the python's FastAPI framework. 

To run the application, we require the api keys from the rapid api, [mutual fund nav](https://rapidapi.com/suneetk92/api/latest-mutual-fund-nav) and set them in the envs. Along with that we need to pass a dummpy username, password and access token for the auth verifications. 


Once those are completed, we can proceed with the running the application with the command, 
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
